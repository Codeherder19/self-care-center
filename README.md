## Instructions for running/viewing the project:
This page will generate a random mantra or affirmation for the user. Just click on either the affirmation (left) button or the mantra (right) to make a choice, then click on receive message and a random mantra or affirmation will be displayed for the user. There is a "no repeat" feature included, so the user will see every mantra or affirmation before they are alerted that the category will begin repeating messages based on the chosen category.

Future Additions:
1. The ability to edit the list of mantras/affirmations by either removing messages or adding your own.
2. Animating the page with graphics or color changes when the receive message button is clicked and the user is waiting to view their mantra/affirmation.
3. More accurate responsiveness so the web page scales for different sized screens, whether that be large monitors or small screens on mobile phones.

Wins:
- Productively struggling and (slightly) learning flex-box.
- Refactoring code to have a minimal amount of functions that are dynamic and reusable.

Challenges:
- Trying to achieve responsiveness by using flex-box and percentages for my sizing/margins etc.
- Steep learning curve for flex-box, especially after burning up valuable time sizing and spacing things using pixels.
- Getting the layout to closely match the comp took the majority of the project time.
